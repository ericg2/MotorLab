     * In this file, we are going to define a Constant value used for determining the ID of the Xbox Controller
     * we want to access. This is needed because multiple devices can be plugged into the Driver Station at the same
     * time, and we need a way to tell apart each device.<p>
     *
     * For example,
     * the Left Stick is always plugged into Port 0,
     * the Right Stick is always plugged into Port 1,
     * and our Xbox Controller is plugged into Port 2.<p>
     *
     * Create a Constant variable identical to the SPECIAL_NUMBER above this, instead naming it CONTROLLER_ID, and
     * giving it the value of 2. It should look like the example below. Based on the info, attempt making a constant
     * variable for the Xbox Controller ID.<p>
     *
     * example: public static int SPECIAL_NUMBER = 7
