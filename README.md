# ROXBOTIX Boot Camp #1
### Motor and Button Programming (created 12/7/2022)

## Please read entire file before proceeding with code!

Welcome to the very first programming bootcamp for Roxbotix! This project layout 
is nearly identical to what you will see in a competition Robot project. There are 
detailed comments and descriptions above nearly every important file that can be read.

The file you are reading right now is called a <b>README</b>, which is very useful
as it allows people to have a general idea of what your program is about, before looking
at any code and figuring it out themselves.

After learning the methods and classes robot programs use from the Bootcamp slides, you will
now be able to program in a basic motor controller. Each file is marked with instructions 
to successfully create your code.

In the end, you will be using the <b>Xbox Controller</b> to create a basic motor speed Command,
that will make the motor spin faster the more you push down the trigger, and have a reverse option.
